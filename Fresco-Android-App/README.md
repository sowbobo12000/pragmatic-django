## Testing Notes
### Version `3.1.0.7`
Hi everyone, and happy holidays!

Fixed a bug: Updates GCM Tokens on app open (if necessary)

You may also feel free to test the same things as the build from last time:
- Includes fixes for assignment acceptance on production
- Uploads of videos with transcoding to compare the quality of the in app camera for photos and videos to your native camera
- Seeing who liked and reposted a gallery by clicking on the count. Try following users from here as well!
- Assignment acceptance: The radius should turn green as soon as you enter the accepted assignment, all other assignments should disappear from the map, you can get directions, it'll even remember if you accepted the assignment if you log out and log back in or close the app and reopen it. Try your hardest to break this feature! If anything seems out of place bring it up!
- Everything on the settings screen. I know, that's a lot but do as much as you can, the entirety of the settings screen has been refactored so the code is easier to deal with. 
- ...and general app usage. Specifically, uploads, and gallery detail sessions.

As always, please contact me (blaze) if there are any issues with the build. Thank you!
